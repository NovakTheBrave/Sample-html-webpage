# Sample-html-webpage

This repository hosts a sample of an example webpage I developed. It can be accessed by downloading the included folder. Than, the SampleDaycareWebsite file should be accessed.
From there, the articles and pre-k subpages can be accessed. Additionally, this webpage is able to detect mobile and tablet users, and will adapt accordingly.
